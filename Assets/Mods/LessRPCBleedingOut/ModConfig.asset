  Title: LessRPCBleedingOut
  GameVersion: 
  ShortDescription: This reduces the chance that an RPC (gangster) bleeds out
  LongDescription: 'In the base game the RPC bleeding out chance is based on morale
    divided by 10 and with an arbitrary +50 value added to the result. This means
    that a gangster with 500 morale will always bleed out instead of dying.


    I
    liked the idea of my gangsters being able to sometimes bleed out but also die,
    which allowed me to vary my playthroughs with different gangsters as the games
    went on.


    This mod removes the +50 value so that the maximum chance a gangster
    has of bleeding out is 50/50.'
