  "$ZELNICK_AND_MAGGIE_Quote_F1_option2":"Did you bring me here to practice your small talk skills, or is there some point to all this?",
  "$ZELNICK_AND_MAGGIE_Quote_F2_say":"I'll take you to school if you're willing to learn, sugar. I could teach you how to do business, if you make a deal with me. You could use it.",
