# eos-modding
A collection of personal mods for Romero Games' Empire of Sin, using their Unity modding tools.

Examples of mods:

- That's my Hood!

I always found it weird that some clearly historic characters could spawn in neighorhoods that they never had a part in; for example, playing Al Capone and begining in Chinatown whilst having Irish gangs in Little Italy made no sense to me. I tried researching the historic Chicago neighborhoods and assigning each faction to the one that felt the more appropriate (this is not historically accurate).

- Boss balancing and game tweaks

Some bosses are clearly stronger than others; I tried to edit values and tweak abilities to balance the playing field a little (some will call this cheating). I even tried correct visual bugs with scripting, which didn't work out too well.
